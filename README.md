# Portfolio Website

**by Gedas Gardauskas**

Portfolio Website project is a recreation of a Udacity provided .PDF design, where I had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. Developing a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to completed or future projects.

## About the project

This Portfolio Website was build using newest Bootstrap v4.0 framework. Bootstrap let's you easily and efficiently scale your websites and applications with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries.I have just included Bootstrap's compiled CSS and JS, using the Bootstrap CDN. In additon to this, I have added Font Awesome icons via CDN.

## This project consists for the following files:

- `styles.css` - custom CSS styles for the website
- `index.html` - main content, HTML file for the website

  *And a few images...*

### File structure:

- `css/` - for stylesheets
- `img/` - for images

## Why having a portfolio website is important to your career?

- Without a portfolio, recruiters won’t even look at your resume much less interview you.
- At their very foundation, web applications are just content delivery mechanisms; HTML defines how that language is structured.
- Reading poorly designed content is never an enjoyable experience; CSS empowers you to create beautiful content regardless of your user’s device.

### Instructions from Udacity:

- Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower right hand corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.
- Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
- Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
- Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
- Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
  - HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
  - CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).

### Extra features:

- Bootstrap navigation bar.
- Created customized design carousel slides.
- Added front-awesome icon.
- Added a sticky footer.
